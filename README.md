# E115-Final
Final project for E115 - Intro to Programming, an intro course for C++ programming

Project requirements for generic: create a game of about 1000 lines of code(although line count is usually not indicative of quality) that uses many of the concepts learned in class. We made the game "chopsticks" with our schools colors in the terminal, a GUI that refreshes with each move, and AI to compete against.
